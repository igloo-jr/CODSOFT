# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

A fun and interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game built using Python.  
The user chooses rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer makes a random choice.

The game determines the winner using classic rules:  
- Rock beats Scissors  
- Scissors beat Paper  
- Paper beats Rock

The program displays both choices and announces the result (win/lose/tie).  
Optionally, it can track scores over multiple rounds and lets the user play again.  
Includes a simple, user-friendly interface with clear instructions.
